#  Automated Root Cause Analysis Platform (ARCA)



##  1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop an **Automated Root Cause Analysis Platform**. This system is designed to automatically identify the root cause of system failures by continuously monitoring logs, metrics, and system events. It aims to reduce the reliance on human expertise and manual troubleshooting.

### 1.2 Scope
In modern software systems, failures often occur due to multiple interconnected issues. This project automates the RCA process by:
* **Continuously monitoring** logs and metrics.
* **Detecting anomalies** automatically.
* **Correlating** related failures.
* **Identifying** the root cause.
* **Suggesting** corrective actions.
